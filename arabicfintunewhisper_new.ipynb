    "This notebook demonstrates a two-stage fine-tuning approach:\n",
    "1. **Stage 1**: Fine-tune Whisper-small on MSA Arabic using Common Voice Arabic dataset\n",
    "2. **Stage 2**: Fine-tune the MSA-adapted model on Egyptian dialect using MASC dataset\n",

    "\n",
    "### What We Accomplished\n",
    "1. **Two-Stage Fine-tuning**: Successfully implemented a hierarchical approach to Arabic dialect ASR\n",
    "2. **Stage 1**: Fine-tuned Whisper on MSA Arabic using dedicated MSA dataset (otozz/MSA) from the codebase collection\n",
    "3. **Stage 2**: Specialized the MSA model for Egyptian dialect using MASC dataset\n",
    "4. **Evaluation**: Compared performance between single-stage and two-stage approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits of This Approach\n",
    "- **Leverages linguistic hierarchy**: MSA provides strong foundation for dialectal understanding\n",
    "- **Uses dedicated MSA dataset**: Better MSA representation compared to generic Common Voice\n",
    "- **Data efficiency**: Makes better use of specialized MSA data to improve dialect performance  \n",

    "\n",
    "## Stage 1: MSA Arabic Foundation\n",
    "- Fine-tuned Whisper-small on Modern Standard Arabic using **MSA dataset (otozz/MSA)** from the codebase collection\n",
    "- This provides better MSA representation compared to generic Common Voice Arabic\n",
    "- Established strong Arabic language understanding as foundation following research methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stage 2: Egyptian Dialect Specialization  \n",
    "- Further fine-tuned the MSA model on Egyptian dialect using MASC dataset\n",
    "- Leveraged hierarchical relationship between MSA and Egyptian dialect\n",
    "- Achieved improved performance on Egyptian dialect speech recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Improvements\n",
    "- **Dataset Alignment**: Now uses the same MSA dataset referenced in `src/training/dialect_peft_training.py`\n",
    "- **Better MSA Foundation**: Specialized MSA dataset instead of generic Common Voice Arabic\n",
    "- **Research Consistency**: Follows the methodology established in the research codebase\n",
    "- **Improved Quality**: Better MSA foundation should lead to improved dialect adaptation\n",
